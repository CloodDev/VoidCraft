# Instructions for creating the Piece of the Void texture:

1. Create a 16x16 pixel PNG image
2. Name it "piece_of_the_void.png"
3. Place it in the directory: src/main/resources/assets/voidcraft/textures/item/
4. Design suggestions:
   - Base color: Dark purple (#2A0845) or pure black (#000000)
   - Add some subtle void-like effects like:
     - Small white/purple sparkles or dots
     - Gradient from dark purple to black
     - Mysterious glowing edges
     - Abstract void-like patterns

For now, you can use any dark-colored 16x16 PNG image as a placeholder.

The item model is already configured to look for this texture at:
"voidcraft:item/piece_of_the_void"
