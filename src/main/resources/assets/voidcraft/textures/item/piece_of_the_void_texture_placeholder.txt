# Piece of the Void Texture
# This is a placeholder for the item texture.
# You need to create a 16x16 pixel PNG file called "piece_of_the_void.png"
# and place it in this directory to replace this placeholder.
# The texture should represent a dark, void-like material - perhaps something
# dark purple or black with some mystical sparkles or void-like effects.
